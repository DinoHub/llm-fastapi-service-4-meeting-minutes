[120.00 - 158.30] [speaker_1] :  The more players you have in on the guest list, the more complicated a meeting mode attempt. But I like to say that if your daily routine is too rigid, you're just trying to control the uncontrollable – and it's my goal to free you from those constraints. I will make what sounds counterintuitive: athletic performance can be more important than your mental well-being.

Topic:      Anabolic Use and its Effect on Mental Health

Sender Date:         April 10, 2023
 
Summary of Presentation:      
This presentation focused on the invisible issues associated with anabolic use and how it affects mental health, particularly in terms of anxiety and trapped thoughts. 

Speaker 1 began by stating his personal experience with the dark side of anabolic use. He shares his struggles with intrusive thoughts and violence and also mentions a perceived reduction in intelligence while taking anabolic drugs.

Speaker 0 then introduced the host of the Checkup Podcast, Dr. Mike Israetel, who discussed the topic of anabolic use and its effects. Dr, Mike highlighted the idea that anabolic use may lead to a sense of dependence on artificial means, such as AI and gene therapy, to achieve physical performance. 

Speaker 1 then emphasized the importance of breaking free from rigid daily routines in order to achieve optimal athletic performance, which would also benefit mental well-being.

Minutes were passed and speaker 1 expressed the sentiment that if our daily routines are too rigid, it can lead to a lack of flexibility and hinder our ability to handle the unpredictable aspects of life.

Speaker 1 became stuck in delivering their intended message but without the receipt of clear answers or coherent follow-up, the conversation began to stray off course and took an input pain cause discouraged dess Enjoy sound relevant topic sending Long
