- You mentioned from personal experience, being aware of the speaker(s) of anabolic use. What is that?

- How long do you have anxiety like you would not believe? Every day that I'm on high doses, I wake up in the morning afraid of the rest of my day. Intrusive thoughts. I think about violence all the time. Well, if your testosterone is 25 times what it's supposed to be, what the hell do you think it's going to make you think about?

Another question is a marked proximate reduction of IQ. Like right now, as I talk to you, I'm on contest prop. I'm on a considerable dose of anabolics. I'm not as smart right now and I can feel it. It's this awe, an inability to perceive a broad spectrum of positive human emotion. I live in a really beautiful area in Michigan and I walk out and I see a pond and these trees, but it's just memory and not reality. I go work out every morning and I look at the pond and the trees and I'm like, like all I feel is rage and frustration and anger and anxiety. That's my daily life.
